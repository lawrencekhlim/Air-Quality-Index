# Air-Quality-Index

### Authors: Lawrence Lim, Yash Rane


Since the Thomas fire and numerous other fires in the Los Angeles-Ventura region have broken out, smoke has travelled west to Santa Barbara County, greatly affecting air quality. We have made charts that illustrate the current air quality in the cities Santa Barbara, Goleta, and Santa Maria. In a couple different places in the data, there were power outages, or no data reported, so labeled are a couple different times relevant to the data.

Interactive charts are also posted on [this link](https://yash-rane.shinyapps.io/Air-Quality-Index/).

We pulled our data from [this link](https://das.sbcapcd.org/StationSummaryNew.aspx).
